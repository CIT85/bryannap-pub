              <figcaption>Cybersecurity, short for "cybersecurity," refers to the practice of protecting internet-connected systems, including hardware, software, and data, from cyber threats. These threats can come in various forms, such as cyberattacks, data breaches, identity theft, and malware infections. The primary goal of cybersecurity is to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and systems from unauthorized access or damage. This involves implementing measures such as firewalls, encryption, antivirus software, intrusion detection systems, and security policies to mitigate risks and prevent cyber incidents.</figcaption>
